# Available actions: Create, Update, Delete and Import.
# After `terraform apply` of this example file it will create a new SyncIQ replication rule on PowerScale.

# PowerScale SyncIQ performance rule allows you to limit the resources used for SyncIQ replication.

  // required

  // type and value of the replication rule limit
  // Units are kb/s for bandwidth, files/s for file-count, processing percentage used for cpu, or percentage of maximum available workers
  type  = "bandwidth"
  limit = 20000

  // optional
  description = "tfacc updated"

    // time in 24h format
    begin = "01:00",
    end   = "22:59",
  }
}

# After the execution of above resource block, syncIQ performance rule would have been created on the PowerScale array.

### Optional

- `description` (String) Description of this performance rule.
- `enabled` (Boolean) Whether this performance rule is currently in effect during its specified intervals.
- `schedule` (Attributes) A schedule defining when during a week this performance rule is in effect.  If unspecified or null, the schedule will always be in effect. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--schedule))

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) The system ID given to this performance rule.

<a id="nestedatt--schedule"></a>
